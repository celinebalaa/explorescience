    <h1 id="title">Synthetic DNA </h1>
    <p>The walls between the physical biological world and the digital one are crumbling toward one another
      Artificial gene synthesis, sometimes known as DNA printing is a method in synthetic biology that is used to create artificial genes in the laboratory and it does not have preexisting DNA sequences to begin with.
      If one can read and write that code of DNA, then they can be reconstructed in a distant location.

    <p>In nature the code of life is stored in only 4 letters: A (Adenine), G(Guanine), T (Thymine) and C(Cytosine).
      Normally, as a pair of DNA strands twist around each other in a double helix, the chemicals on each strand pair up: A bonds to T, and C bonds with G.
      Scientists have doubled this number of life’s building blocks, creating for the first time a synthetic, eight-letter genetic language that seems to store and transcribe information just like natural DNA.
      <br>
      The new codes, labelled P, B, Z and S, are based on the same kind of nitrogenous molecules as existing ones, categorised as purines and pyrimidines.

      Similarly, they link up with hydrogen bonds to form their own base pairs – S bonding with B, and P with Z.

      That's where the similarities fade out. These new 'letters' introduce dozens of new chemical parameters to the double helix structure that potentially affect how it zips and twists.

      By devising models that predict the molecule's stability and then observing actual structures made of this 'alien' DNA, researchers are better equipped what's truly important when it comes to the fundamentals of a genetic template.</p>

    <p>As researchers seek to engineer biological systems with novel DNA sequences, the need for custom synthetic DNA sequences has grown. This is particularly true when the sequences to be engineered are derived from metagenomic sequences in which
      no
      organism may be available from which to isolate the DNA via other methods. The synthesis of synthetic DNA is often referred to generically as “gene synthesis,” which specifically is the synthesis of gene-length pieces of DNA (250–2000 bp)
      directly from single-stranded synthetic DNA oligonucleotides. Unfortunately, whereas the cost of sequencing has decreased precipitously over time, the cost of gene synthesis and oligonucleotide synthesis in general has not kept pace, although
      technological innovation and market forces are progressively lowering the cost of synthetic DNA</p>

    <h2>Writing the code</h2>
    <p>Natural DNA is composed of four molecules, called nitrogenous bases, that pair up with each other to form the code for life on Earth: A binds with T; G binds with C. The Hachimoji DNA includes these four natural bases, plus four more
      synthetically-made nucleotide bases: P, B, Z and S.

      The research group, which included several different teams across the U.S., created hundreds of these Hachimoji double helixes with different combinations of the natural and synthetic nucleotide base pairs. Then, they conducted a series of
      experiments to see if the various double helixes had properties needed to support life.

      Natural DNA has a hallmark property that no other genetic molecule seems to have: It's stable and predictable. That means that researchers can calculate exactly how it will behave in certain temperatures and environments, including when it will
      degrade.

      But it turns out that the researchers were also able to do this with the Hachimoji DNA — they could come up with a set of rules that can predict the DNA's stability when it is exposed to different temperatures.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for life</h2>
    <p>The finding that it's possible to add the four synthetic bases and still get a "code that's predictable and programmable ... that's just unprecedented," said Floyd Romesberg, a chemistry professor at Scripps Research in California, who was not
      a
      part of the study but who previously published research on an earlier six-letter code. This "landmark paper" suggests indeed that G, C, A and T "are not unique," Romesberg told Live Science.
      But creating DNA that stores information isn't enough, Benner noted. It also has to have the ability to transfer that information to its sister molecule RNA, so that that RNA can then instruct proteins to carry out all the business in an
      organism.

      With that in mind, the researchers developed synthetic enzymes — proteins that facilitate a reaction — that successfully copied Hachimoji DNA into Hachimoji RNA. Furthermore, they found that the RNA molecule was able to fold into a sort of L
      shape that would be necessary for it to further transfer information.

      In addition, the DNA strands must be able to twist into the same three-dimensional structure — the famed double-helix.

      The team created three crystal structures of Hachimoji DNA, each with different sequences of the eight base pairs, and found that indeed, each formed the classic double helix.

      Still, in order for the Hachimoji DNA to support life, there's a fifth requirement, Benner said. That is, it needs to be self-sustaining or have the ability to survive on its own. However, the researchers stopped short of investigating this
      step,
      in order to prevent the molecule from becoming a biohazard that could one day work its way into the genomes of organisms on Earth.

      Synthetic Biology Could Supply Food, Fuel on Mission to Mars
      Synthetic biological processes could turn waste, soil and gases into fuel, food, medicine and raw materials for 3-D printing.
      Mars is a long way off. About 34 million miles away, depending on planetary orbits.
      Space agencies planning a mission there have estimated that sending six crew members to the Red Planet would take about 916 days - 210 days for travel there and
      back and a 496-day stay on the Martian surface.
      That's a lot of packing to do. In fact, NASA estimates that for every unit mass of payload launched, an additional 99 units of mass is needed to support the crew.
      We're talking fuel, oxygen, food, medicine, etc.
      But two scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have put forth an idea in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface that could shrink the supporting payload and significantly reduce the cost for such a venture.

      They propose using synthetic biological processes to turn crew waste, Martian soil, minerals and gases from the atmosphere into propellants, food, medicine and raw materials for three-dimensional printing.

      "Not only does synthetic biology promise to make the travel to extraterrestrial locations more practical and bearable, it could also be transformative once explorers arrive at their destination," Adam Arkin, director of Berkeley Lab's Physical
      Biosciences Division said in a press release.

      Arkin, a leading authority on synthetic and systems biology, published the study with Amor Menzes.
      For example, crew members could turn carbon dioxide into methane for fuel. They could use microbes to sustain plant-based farming and produce pharmaceuticals. They could turn minerals into the raw materials for 3-D printing.
      Their calculations show that by turning to synthetic biology they could reduce payloads. Specifically, they could reduce the amount of fuel needed by 56 percent; they could reduce food by 38 percent; they could reduce the amount of materials
      needed to build a habitat for six people by 85 percent; they could reduce pharmaceuticals by 100 percent.

      "We've got a long way to go since experimental proof-of-concept work in synthetic biology for space applications is just beginning, but long-duration manned missions are also a ways off," says Menezes.

      In short, there's plenty of time to perfect such a system. But the real-world tests don't have to start with Mars. The plan works for a trip to the Moon, as well.
